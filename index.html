      <h2>Web Development Student</h2>
      <p>In 2007, I moved to the US, from Vietnam, for study. After I graduated high school I felt lost and did not know what to do with my future. At the recommendation of my parents, I studied Business Administration. Two years passed, when I had to pick a major to continue to my college education I picked Physics. Two months later I ended up in Mechanical Engineering and finished the degree.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>During my work in the mechanical engineering field, I came to realize software development, as a field, has an ability to scale immensely. So I decide to go back to school. I hope one day I will be able to set up and run an ecommerce store on my own.</p>
